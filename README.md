# Snake Game

A classic Snake game built using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). This project includes basic snake movement, fruit collection, scorekeeping, and game-over conditions.

## Features

- Basic snake movement controlled by arrow keys
- Fruit collection to increase score and snake length
- Game-over conditions when snake collides with itself or the boundaries
- Scoreboard to keep track of the player's score
- Pause and resume functionality
- High-quality font for displaying scores and messages

## Upcoming Features

- Different types of fruits with varying scores
- Mines that deduct points or end the game
- More sound effects for different actions
- Special power-ups and obstacles
- Level progression and increasing difficulty
- Improved graphical effects and animations

## Requirements

- C++11 or higher
- SFML library (2.6.1 or later)
- A compatible compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lgyeee/SnakeGame.git

   ```

2. Install SFML:

   On macOS:
   ```bash
   brew install sfml
   ```

   On Ubuntu:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
   ```

3. Build the project using Makefile:
